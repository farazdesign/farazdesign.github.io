<h4>Introduction:</h4>

<p>I am a naturally talented artist with an analytically gifted mind. My career has been as an Analyst, but I want to pursue a more creative role. I want to harness my creative and analytical skills and become a UX/UI Designer.

The very first day of school in preschool all I did was draw every animal I could think of. Since that day I have always had a passion for drawing. So I want to harness that creative side of me in my next chapter of my career.

I am a huge tech history nerd and my favorite books are the <i>Steve Jobs</i> biography and <i>The Innovators</i> by Walter Isaacson. 
</p>

<h4>What introduced you to design?</h4>

<p>My first experience UX/UI and product design was when I was young and I got my hands on the very first Apple iPod a friend let me try. Growing up and until this day music is a huge passion for me and I can listen to just about any genre. Iâ€™ve had cd players, mp3, mini-disc you name it. Then I finally got a chance to see what true design was with the very first Apple iPod.

The Apple iPod changed the game for me because I could connect with a product and knew that the designers had created something that made my user experience so easy to use and the user interface was so clean and aesthetically pleasing. 

Apple has always been one of my favorite companies because they have changed the game in so many fronts. But I will always appreciate what other companies have done as well. My first computer was only possible because of Microsoft.

Another first time I was introduced to UX was when I first started using Google. I was fascinated by how easy it was to navigate the web and search for all my answers.
</p>

<h4>Why is design important to you? How can you use design to make a difference?</h4>

<p>Design is important to me because it allows all humans to interact with various objects and services with ease. Design can be found in many forms from fashion, automotive, and apps. 

Good design allows companies to succeed otherwise users will flock to another product or service. 

We live in a society that relies on various products and services that must have great design. Otherwise business and governments will fail us - it is imperative that companies hire great designers for the future.
