          “It’s through mistakes that you actually can grow. You have to get bad in order to get good.”</em> - Paula
        Scher
      </p>
      <p class="flow-text">
        I am a UX/UI designer with a passion for design, code, and art. I have the unique ability to harness both sides
        of my brain because I am both analytical and artistic.
      </p>

      <p class="flow-text">
        My career has been as an Analyst working with various companies including small start-ups, non-profits, and
        large corporate organizations. I have worked on projects designing and testing business applications and
        analyzing large sets of data with advanced MS Excel techniques and SQL queries. I have worked alongside
        Operations Managers, Marketing Managers, Product Managers, UX/UI Designers, and Developers both locally and
        remotely.
      </p>

      <p class="flow-text">
        Design has been around for ages and only most recently with the internet revolution a new paradigm has shifted
        in our society. More and more consumers and businesses rely on software applications in their daily lives. Web
        and mobile apps that have a lasting impact are the ones that can adapt and change with the flow of time.
      </p>

      <p class="flow-text">
        Design trends are constantly changing, the best example of this is the iPhone. Every year Apple designs a new
        iPhone or else their consumers will gravitate to another new and exciting phone. Competitors such as Google and
        Samsung are always trying to out design Apple to lure away customers. The company that iterates rapidly and
        produces better design and user experience will hold a competitive advantage.
      </p>

      <p class="flow-text">
        It is paramount that industries hire good Designers that understand the market trends and can create engaging
        products.
      </p>



      <h2 class="center">What introduced you to design?</h2>

      <p class="flow-text">
        My first experience with great UX/UI was when I was young and I got my hands on the very first Apple iPod. I
        love music and I had all types of devices back in the day including cd players, mp3, and mini-disc. Then I
        finally got a chance to see what true design is with the very first Apple iPod. The Apple iPod changed the game
        for me because I not only appreciated the great hardware design, I also loved the software design. The iPod was
        so easy and intuitive it gave me a great user experience that no other product or company could give.
      </p>

      <h2 class="center">History Nerd</h2>



      <p class="flow-text">



        I am a huge history nerd, my favorite books are <em>Steve Jobs</em> and <em>The Innovators</em> by Walter
        Isaacson. The tech
        revolution has impacted so many lives and has changed our society in so many ways.
        I am so grateful for companies like Apple, Microsoft, and Google. There are numerous companies I can name, but
        I would like to talk about these three and how they impacted millions of lives, including mine, with great user
        experiences and design and how each of them inspires me to be a great UX/UI Designer.
      </p>


      <h4 class="center">
        Apple
      </h4>

      <p class="center flow-text">
        <em>
          "Your work is going to fill a large part of your life, and the only way to be truly satisfied is to do what
          you believe is great work. And the only way to do great work is to love what you do. If you haven’t found it
          yet, keep looking and don’t settle."
        </em>
        - Steve Jobs
      </p>

      <p class="flow-text">
        Apple has brought numerous technological advances to the consumer market. Apple created the first true personal
        computer that started the catalyst for the personal computer industry. The iPod and iTunes revolutionized the
        music industry and allowed consumers to experience what great designed products can really do. The iPod led to
        the most revolutionary tech product of current time, the iPhone. The iPhone allowed essentialy all humans with
        a smartphone to
        become cyborgs. Every human with a smartphone has so much information at their fingertips. Apple is
        successful because it creates hardware and software designs that give consumers an intuitive user experience
        that keeps consumers coming back. This is critical to understand as a Designer whether you like Apple or not,
        you have to appreciate the impact Apple has had on the Information Age.
      </p>

      <h4 class="center">
        Microsoft
      </h4>

      <p class="center flow-text">
        <em>
          "Don’t compare yourself with anyone in this world…if you do so, you are insulting yourself."

        </em>
        - Bill Gates
      </p>

      <p class="flow-text">
        Microsoft is important for the tech revolution because it was the first company to really become successful
        purely on software design. Microsoft operating systems allowed the masses to experience their first personal
        computers at an affordable price, including me. Like millions of consumers, I would never have had my first
        computer without a Microsoft Windows. Apple would not have survived if Microsoft did not step in and
        save the company when Steve Jobs returned. I am always grateful for Microsoft and what they have contributed to
        the Information Age. It is important to have respect for such a great company that has impacted so many lives
        with great software design.
      </p>

      <h4 class="center">
        Google
      </h4>

      <p class="center flow-text">
        <em>
          “Coming up with an idea is the least important part of creating something great. It has to be the right idea
          and have good taste, but the execution and delivery are what’s key”

      </p>

      <p class="flow-text">
        Google is crucial for the Tech industry for organizing the internet. Google has made the user experience for
        navigating the internet so much easier. I recall useing numerous search engines such as Yahoo, Hotbot, and
        Altavista. Google had a simple UI and produced greater search
        results. The user experience was so great that I stopped using all other search engines.
        Google also challenged Apple
        once they started the smartphone revolution with their Android mobile OS. This allowed the consumer to have a
        choice and created competition for Apple. No one company should have a monopoly in any industry and I am
        grateful for Google for creating great user experiences and designs in their products. In any role you work in
        these days the ability to search with Google is imperative in order to be successful. As a Designer or
        Developer, Google has made it so much easier to quickly find answers.
