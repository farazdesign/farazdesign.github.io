  <h4>Site Map</h4>
  <h4>Wireframes</h4>
  <h4>Low Fi Mockups</h4>
  <h4>Low Fi Testing</h4>
  <p>
    Summary: The users were able to perform the test with ease, but there are some lessons learned for the future: 1)Users were
    clicking on the image instead of the button 2) Users tried to drag the workout, but due to invision limitations they
    were not able to because of limitations to InVision 3) Overall the users were able to navigate the app with with ease
    Overall the users were able to Sign up for an account. Adding a piece of content and organizing a piece of content were
    very similar for the app design. The users were able to add content to the Fitness Program and organize it before sending
    to their client. Lessons learned to improve the solution: 1) Users should be able to see the Sign Up Call to Action button
    above the fold on the landing page 2) Users were trying to drag the workouts into the date they selected.

  <h4>Conclusion</h4>

  <p>Design is important to me because it allows all humans to interact with various objects and services with ease. Design
    can be found in many forms from fashion, automotive, and apps. Good design allows companies to succeed otherwise users
    will flock to another product or service. We live in a society that relies on various products and services that must
    have great design. Otherwise business and governments will fail us - it is imperative that companies hire great designers
    for the future.
